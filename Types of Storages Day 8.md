# Operating System

## Types of Storages

Storages are used to store the files, data and instructions.
There are two types of storages. They are
1. Primary Memory
2. Secondary Memory

**Primary Memory**  
The different storage devices in the primary memory are
1. Register
2. Cache
3. Main Memory(RAM)
   
> Primary memory is volatile. When you shutdown the system all the data is flushed or vanished form the storage devices.

**Secondary Memory**  
The different storage devices in the secondary memory are
1. Electronic Disk
1. Magnetic Disk
2. Optical Disk
3. Magnetic Tapes

> Secondary memory is non-volatile. When you turn off the system all the data will be stored inside the storage devices.

**Register**
- Register is situated very nearer to the CPU.
- Register is the smallest unit of storage.
- Actual computation takes place in register. CPU will work on the data stored inside the register.
- Data is stored in the form of 0/1 inside the register.
- All the instructions are fetched from the memory and stored inside the register.

**Cache**
 - Cache is the second level of storage. 
 - After registers, cache is situated nearer to the CPU.
 - When a CPU is executing the process, it requires instructions and data to complete its execution.
 - If the CPU is accessing the particular instructions or data repeatedly these instructions or data is kept inside the cache. so, that the cost is reduced and the CPU takes less time to access those instructions and data.
 - Cache is faster than Main memory(RAM)

**Main memory(RAM)**
- All processes reside inside the RAM.
- CPU fetches the instructions from the RAM and execute them
- When the program comes into memory for execution it is calles process.
 
**Secondary Memory**
- Secondary memory stores all the programs, data, media and files inside it.

### Comparison between storage devices

1. Cost:
   - Register is more costlier compared to all storage devices. 
   - It is because it is situated nearer to CPU and it is accessed by the CPU very fast without any delay. So, to achieve this it is made of silicon, rare metals and costly items.
   - Cache is less costlier comapre to Register but more costlier compared to RAM.
   - RAM is less costlier copared to Cache.
   - Secondary memory storage devices are less costlier compared to RAM.
2. Speed:
   - Register is very fast compared to other storage devices followed by cache, RAM, SSD in secondary memory.   
3. Capacity/size:
   - The capacity of Register is 32-bits or 64-bits.
   - The capacity of Cache is in KB's or MB's.
   - The capacity of Ram is in GB's.
   - The capacity of secondary memory storage devices is TB's.
4. Voltality:
   - Primary memory storage devices are volatile.
   - Secondary memory storage devices are non-volatile.
